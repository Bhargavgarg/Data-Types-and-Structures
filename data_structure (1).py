# Assignment : Python - Data Structure
"""



"""1. What are data structures, and why are they important?

Ans -> Data structures are ways to store and organize data so it can be used efficiently. They are important because they make data access, modification, and management faster and easier.
2.  Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples?

Ans -> Mutable: Can be changed after creation. Example: list, dict, set.

Immutable: Cannot be changed after creation. Example: tuple, str, int.
3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?

Ans -> List → Mutable, slower, uses more memory.

Tuple → Immutable, faster, uses less memory.
4. Describe how dictionaries store data?

Ans -> They store data as key-value pairs using a hash table internally.
5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?

Ans -> Because sets remove duplicates automatically and allow faster lookups.
6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list

Ans -> A string is a sequence of characters (immutable). A list is a collection of items (mutable).
7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python

Ans -> They are immutable, so their values can’t be changed accidentally.
8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?

Ans -> A hash table is a structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. Python dictionaries are built on hash tables.
9.  Can lists contain different data types in Python?

Ans -> Yes, lists can store integers, strings, objects, or even other lists together.
10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python?

Ans -> For safety, efficiency, and to make them hashable so they can be used as dictionary keys.
11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?

Ans -> Dictionaries allow fast lookups by key, while lists require searching through elements.
12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?

Ans -> When storing fixed data like GPS coordinates (28.7041, 77.1025) that should not change.
13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?

Ans -> They automatically remove duplicates and keep only unique values.
14.  How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?

Ans -> List → Checks if the value exists.

Dictionary → Checks if the key exists.
15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.

Ans -> No, because tuples are immutable.
16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?

Ans -> A dictionary inside another dictionary.
Example **students = {"John": {"age": 20, "grade": "A"}}**
17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?

Ans -> Average case: O(1) (very fast due to hash tables).
18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?

Ans -> When order matters, and you only need simple data without key-value pairing.
19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval

Ans -> Before Python 3.7, they didn’t store items in insertion order. Retrieval is by key, not position.
20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.

Ans -> List → Retrieve by position (index).

Dictionary → Retrieve by key.
